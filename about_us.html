        <h1>What is UrbanRail.Net?</h1>
        <p>
          UrbanRail.Net is a website documenting the various urban railway systems e.g. Metro, Subway, Tram, Suburban rail, etc. of the world.
          Each city's transit system is given an overview, with details about the system's history, lines and future expansions,
          complete with photographs. There are also corresponding links to external sites for further reading.
          UrbanRail.Net is intended to be kept up-to-date as much as possible, so as to always provide an accurate description of each system.
        </p>
        <h1>How did UrbanRail.Net begin?</h1>
        <p>It all started in 1995 with a page for Barcelona, before expanding into Europe in 1997, with the site being called euroMetro.
          It was renamed metroPlanet in 1999, following the addition of systems outside of Europe, with sections for Asia, Africa, the Americas and Oceania.
          However, the site had to be renamed to UrbanRail.Net over copyright issues.
