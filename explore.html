        <h1>Urban rail systems defined</h1>
        <h2>Metro</h2>
        <p>
          Metro systems, also known as subways, undergrounds, or MRTs, are usually defined as a fully grade-separated electrified urban railway system
          with high train frequencies. Such systems are usually built, but not always, underground. Train capacity can vary from tiny people mover systems
          to high-capacity systems with 6-8 car trains. Examples include the London Underground and the Paris Metro.
        </p>
        <h2>Tram</h2>
        <p>
          Trams, also known as streetcars or trolleys in North America, usually run on the surface, sharing the road with other vehicles.
          Vehicles may be high-floor or low-floor. Newer tramways may also have sections of segregated on-street running i.e. the tracks are
          built on the surface but separated from the main road.
        </p>
        <h2>Light rail</h2>
        <p>Light rail systems may be confused with trams as they use similar vehicles, but can be distinguished by greater sections of grade-separated track, including tunnels,
          although level crossings do exist. Examples include the Tuen Mun Light Rail in Hong Kong and the numeroud Stadtbahn systems across Germany.
        </p>
        <h2>Suburban Rail</h2>
        <p>
          Suburban rail, also known as commuter rail, describe heavy rail systems which usually extend far out into the suburban areas of a city
          and/or converge in the city centre. Compared to metros, frequency is much lower (although some systems do see metro-style frequencies in the centre),
          there is less grade separation (more level crossings and/or sharing traffic with mainline/intercity rail), and trains are much larger and have fewer doors
          than on a metro.
