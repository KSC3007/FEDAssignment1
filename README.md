# FEDAssignment1
This is my FED 1 Project: a revamp of the Urbanrail.net website.

Urbanrail.net is a website which showcases the many urban railway systems around the world e.g. metros/subways, suburban/commuter rail, trams, monorails, etc. It does so by including a regularly-updated map of the entire system's network, differentiating between modes where possible.
However, the site's layout is very mobile-unfriendly, with small buttons and a hard-to-navigate interface. In addition, the site has a very outdated look and feel.
The purpose of this FED Project is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to revamp Urbanrail.net to give it a more modern look and feel, as well as to make it more mobile and user-friendly.
